                <p>It was very good stay over here and it was our first stay overall the property is very good nice decorated Lobby , restaurant by the name of Delhi barbecue is a great choice for food . Staff is well mannered . Mr. Vishnu gave us very good service during our breakfast and their GRE by the name of Ms. Aaakanksha was great very good in guest handling and other staff named as Ms. Arpita provided us smooth check in , Mr. Dhirender Dagar gave us very comfortable room and Mr. Praveen assisted us with our luggage. So I would like to recommend this hotel to everyone.</p>

                <h4>About Staybnb</h4>
                <p>If hotels can offer travelers a superior online experience, the traveler will naturally associate that emotion with the brand itself building loyalty and driving conversions. However, compelling hotel website design isn’t as easy as waving the magical marketing wand and shouting a spell you once read in a Harry Potter book. It requires a lot careful planning and a strategic understanding of the customer’s path to purchase. There are a number of different qualities that some the best and most inspirational hotel websites share, and if any of them are ignored then brands run the risk of not only losing bookings but customers who navigate away never to return.</p>
